# ✅ Errors Fixed - Ready to Start!

## What Was Fixed

- ✅ TypeScript compilation errors in backend
- ✅ Variable naming issues in frontend (changed `eval` to `evaluation`)
- ✅ Missing type annotations
- ✅ Unused imports removed

## 🚀 Start the Servers Now

### In Your External Terminal (with Node.js v22.20.0):

```bash
cd /home/jacob/Desktop/bandinator
pnpm dev
```

### What You Should See:

**Backend Output:**

```
✅ Database initialized successfully
🚀 Backend server running on http://localhost:3001
📁 Uploads directory: ./uploads
💾 Database directory: ./data
```

**Frontend Output:**

```
VITE v5.x.x  ready in xxx ms

  ➜  Local:   http://localhost:3000/
  ➜  Network: use --host to expose
  ➜  press h + enter to show help
```

### If Servers Don't Start:

**Check for Port Conflicts:**

```bash
# Kill any process on port 3001
lsof -ti:3001 | xargs kill -9

# Kill any process on port 3000
lsof -ti:3000 | xargs kill -9
```

**Start Separately (if parallel start fails):**

Terminal 1:

```bash
cd /home/jacob/Desktop/bandinator
pnpm --filter app-backend dev
```

Terminal 2:

```bash
cd /home/jacob/Desktop/bandinator
pnpm --filter app-frontend dev
```

### Verify Servers Are Running:

**Test Backend:**

```bash
curl http://localhost:3001/health
# Should return: {"status":"ok","timestamp":"2025-10-19T..."}
```

**Test Frontend:**
Open browser: http://localhost:3000

You should see:

- ✅ Interactive dashboard
- ✅ Quick action cards
- ✅ Navigation with Home, Documents, Tenders, Rules, Analysis, Search, Chat

### Common Issues:

**Issue: "EADDRINUSE: Port already in use"**

```bash
# Find and kill the process
ps aux | grep node
kill -9 <PID>
```

**Issue: "Cannot find module"**

```bash
# Reinstall dependencies
rm -rf node_modules packages/*/node_modules
pnpm install
```

**Issue: Still getting TypeScript errors**
The errors are now fixed in the code. If your dev server was already running, stop it (Ctrl+C) and restart:

```bash
pnpm dev
```

### Success Checklist:

- [ ] Stopped any previous `pnpm dev` processes (Ctrl+C)
- [ ] Ran `pnpm dev` in external terminal
- [ ] See "Backend server running" message
- [ ] See "Local: http://localhost:3000" message
- [ ] Can open http://localhost:3000 in browser
- [ ] See dashboard with recent activity panels

### Next Steps Once Running:

1. **Upload a Document**: Click "Upload Document" quick action or go to Documents page
2. **Add Attributes**: Fill in category, domain, project, tags
3. **Create a Rule**: Go to Rules page and create evaluation rules
4. **Create a Tender**: Go to Tenders page and add a tender
5. **Run Analysis**: Go to Analysis page and evaluate
6. **Try Search**: Click Search and enter keywords
7. **Try Chat**: Click Chat and ask questions
